    - It has been long thought desirable to decorate one’s automobile by the addition
      of decorative wheels. It has further been thought desirable to communicate with
      others by means of addressable electronic displays. The concept of combining
      decorative automobile wheels with an addressable electronic display is a relatively
      new one which produces novel and visually interesting results.
